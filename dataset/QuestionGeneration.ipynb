The 12 days of Christmas are all about fasting and penance to commemorate the suffering faced by Jesus. The last day of the 12-day series is known as Christmas and is celebrated on December 25 every year. It falls on the winter solstice day in the Roman calendar and is the darkest day of the year. The birth of Jesus comes as a ray of hope and marks the beginning of a journey towards enlightenment. Christmas is all about decorating Christmas trees, eating with families and friends, and having lots of fun. The core values of sharing are instilled in children from the beginning, and they learn to have a deep sense of moral values. Christmas shouldn’t be used only to have fun. It is the time when we should think about the plight of those people who are less fortunate than us. It is the time when charity works are organized all across the globe, and the revenues generated from them are used for the betterment of the poor and the needy. People use this time to reconnect with their family and friends over a delicious dinner; they play games and give them gifts. This fosters the familial ties between people and makes them happier and joyful.\")"
